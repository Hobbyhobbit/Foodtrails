General Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
It has been noted by many people that the architectural design of the Polymensa
 is sub-par.
 The queue formation seems chaotic in nature and not predetermined.
 For example, people are forced to cross each others paths.
 The question arises if there is room for improvement or if the current
 system is already optimal as it is.
 More broadly speaking, this is a problem concerning pedestrian/crowd dynamics.
 How do pedestrians chose their paths and how do they interact.
 Pedestrian dynamics has many fields of application (such as evacuation)
 and is becoming more important as cities and buildings are more densely
 populated.
 There have been many proposed models for pedestrian dynamics.
 A well known example is the Social Force Model of 1995 (Helbing Dirk et.
 al).

Expected Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang british
Results which resemble the crowd behaviour observed at the Polymensa are
 expected.
 This means queue formation at similar localities and similar flow of pedestrian
s per unit of time.
 We expect that the flow of pedestrians per unit of time can be influenced
 by the number of different destinations.
 The more destinations the slower the whole process.

\begin_layout Section
Description of Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section aims to describe the social force model.
 The social force model aims to reduce pedestrian dynamics to force fields.
 Force fields act upon agents.
 Agents are an abstraction of pedestrians.
 The nomenclature used is consistent with the paper

\begin_layout Subsection
Force Fields 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All objects recognizable by an agent have a potential field.
 Using the potential field of a repulsive or attractive object the force
 at a certain location and time may be determined.
 The final force acting on an agent is the superposition of all forces.
 These forces are: (1) Destination, (2) other agents, (3) boarders/buildings/wal
ls, (4) objects of attraction.
 These will be described more closely in the following section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

 attracts an agent.
 An agent will attempt to take the most direct route to reach his destination.
 The vector from an agent to the closest destination point forms the desired
 direction.
 The force caused by the destination is referred to as acceleration term.
 It is independent of distance and time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\vec{e}_{\alpha}(t):= & \frac{\vec{r}_{\alpha}^{k}-\vec{r}_{\alpha}(t)}{||\vec{r}_{\alpha}^{k}-\vec{r}_{\alpha}(t)||}\\
\vec{F}_{\alpha}^{0}(\vec{v}_{\alpha},\vec{v}_{\alpha}^{0},\vec{e}_{\alpha}(t)):= & \frac{1}{\tau_{\alpha}}(v_{\alpha}^{0}\vec{e}_{\alpha}-\vec{v}_{\alpha})
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Other Pedestrians/Agents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An agent attempts to avoid other agents.
 Therefore other agents have a repulsive nature.
 This repulsive nature is described by a monotonically decreasing potential
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\alpha\beta}[b(\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta})]$
\end_inset

.
 This potential field has elliptic equipotent lines (See Figure 1).
 The agent is at the center of the ellipses.
 The semi major axis is aligned parallel to the desired direction of the
 agent.
 The potential is calculated as a function of the semi minor axis of the
 ellipse which is in turn dependent on the agent to agent distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Potential :}V_{\alpha\beta}\left[b\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta}\right]= & V_{\alpha\beta}^{0}e^{-b/\sigma}\\
\textrm{ semi Axis: }b= & \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{||\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta}||+||\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta}-v_{\beta}\Delta te_{\beta}||^{2}-(v_{\beta}\Delta t)||}\\
\text{Force Field: }\vec{f}_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta})= & -\nabla_{\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta}}V_{\alpha\beta}\left[b(\vec{r}_{\alpha\beta})\right]
\end{align*}

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly one must take into consideration that the field of vision of an agent
 has an influence on the forces.
 An other agent which is standing behind agent alpha will have a considerably
 smaller influence than one which agent alpha is facing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\vec{F}_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{e}_{\alpha},\vec{r}_{\alpha}-\vec{r}_{\beta}):= & w(\vec{e}_{\alpha},-\vec{f}_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{r}_{\alpha}-\vec{r}_{\beta}))\vec{f}_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{r}_{\alpha}-\vec{r}_{\beta})\\
w(\vec{e},\vec{f}):= & \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if }\vec{e}\cdot\vec{f}\geq||\vec{f}||cos\varphi\\
c & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Boarders/ Buildings/ Walls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Boarders, buildings and walls repulse agents.
 They induce monotonically decreasing potential fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{boundry Repulsion Force }\vec{F}_{\alpha B}= & -\nabla_{\vec{r_{\alpha B}}}U_{\alpha B}(||\vec{r}_{\alpha B}||)\\
U_{\alpha B}(||\vec{r}_{\alpha B}||)= & U_{^{0}\alpha B}e^{-||\vec{r}_{\alpha B}||/R}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Objects of Attraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects of attraction draw agents towards themselves.
 They are similar to destination forces.
 This force is a function of time as it decays over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{attractive Force }\vec{f_{\alpha i}}(||\vec{r}_{\alpha i}||,t)= & -\nabla_{\vec{r}_{\alpha i}}\cdot W_{\alpha i}(||\vec{r}_{\alpha i}||,t)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with other agents attractive objects must be weighed according to the
 field of vision of the agent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\vec{F}_{\alpha i}(\vec{e}_{\alpha},\vec{r}_{\alpha}-\vec{r}_{\beta}):= & w(\vec{e}_{\alpha},-\vec{f}_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{r}_{\alpha}-\vec{r}_{\beta}))\vec{f}_{\alpha i}(\vec{r}_{\alpha}-\vec{r}_{\beta})\\
w(\vec{e},\vec{f}):= & \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if }\vec{e}\cdot\vec{f}\geq||\vec{f}||cos\varphi\\
c & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Total Force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total force is the superposition of the above mentioned forces.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{F}_{\alpha}(t)=\vec{F_{\alpha}^{0}}(\vec{v}_{\alpha}\vec{v}_{\alpha}^{0}\vec{e}_{\alpha})+\sum_{\beta}\vec{F}_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{e}_{\alpha},\vec{r}_{\alpha}-\vec{r}_{\beta})+\sum_{B}\vec{F}_{\alpha B}(\vec{e}_{\alpha},\vec{r}_{\alpha}-\vec{r}_{B}^{\alpha})+\sum_{i}\vec{F}_{\alpha i}(\vec{e}_{\alpha},\vec{r}_{\alpha}-\vec{r}_{i},t)
